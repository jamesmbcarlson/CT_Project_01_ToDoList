Project: To-Do List Application

Author: James Carlson

This project was built as an assignment for Coding Temple.
The objective of the mini-project is to reinforce my own understanding of Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling while building an interactive application.

Using the command-line interface, the user will be prompted with the following options:
1. Add a task
2. View tasks
3. Mark a task as complete
4. Prioritize a task
5. Delete a task
6. Quit

By entering the name of an option or its corresponding number, the user will be further prompted to add to their list, select a task to be marked as complete, select a task to be marked as a priority, or select a task to delete items. Items can be referenced by their full string value or by their corresponding number seen on the list as it is printed to the console.

A task marked as a priority is displayed in red text and sent to the top of the list.

A task marked as complete is displayed in green and sent to the bottom of the list.

Otherwise, tasks are displayed in yellow and are kept in the order they are entered.
